# Overview
Kalman filters are a useful algorithm in robotics for 

# Learning Goals
Connor
- Pre-plan and iteratively rescoped project (be intentional about what we're doing, when)
- learn a new algorithm and be confident about it (be able to teach it well)
- create learning materials useable by other Oliners

Charlie
- learn a new algorithm and be confident about it (be able to teach it well)
- well scaffolded project
- focus on core conceptual understanding

# Project Schedule
## Week 1
- Class 20 (F 11/9)
  - Write Project Proposal
  - Find Reference Texts
  - For next time: Choose one text, take notes, and understand how that text describes filters
  - On radar: Read about linear vs. nonlinear
- Class 21 (T 11/13)
  - Synthesize information from texts
  - Begin basic KF: Define context of example (scaffold)
  - Aside: Ask Paul about IMU implementation, covariance matrices
  - For next class: Finish writing out scaffolding and take a stab at stuff
- Class 22 (F 11/16)
  - Write more sections of example and corner Paul
  
THANKSGIVING

- Class 23 (T 11/27)
- Class 24 (F 11/30)
- Class 25 (T 12/4)
- Class 26 (F 12/7)
- Final Demo

# Deliverables
- Some form of learning materials designed to show students why kalman filters are useful, how they work, and when to implement them. Also provide further resources in an accessible manner. Some example code for basic implementation OR simple example. (google docs colab ipython notebook structured like in-class materials) (problem set and solution?!?!?!)
- Simple robot localizing: Drive square, straight line, spin in place and determine error. Compare with ceiling localization as ground truth. Compare with odometry localizing and encoders (separately) as baseline comparison.
