## Most Useful Resources


## Texts

[1] Hall, David L. and McMullen, Sonya A.H., _Mathematical Techniques in Multisensor Data Fusion_. Artech House, 2004
- _Good sections overviewing general strategies and structures for multisensor fusion; presents problems with respect to localizing
multiple targets (read, military applications). Extensively references Kalman filters as industry standard. No explicit walkthrough
of practical Kalman filter application._  

[2] Gomex, Joaquin M., _Kalman Filtering_. Nova Science Publishers Inc. 2011
