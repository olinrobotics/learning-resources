Full indexed list of resources read, used, and found for the project. Resources are sorted into categories by type, with an 
additional category of "most useful" resources, as categorized by this project's authors.

## Most Useful Resources


## Texts

[1] Hall, David L. and McMullen, Sonya A.H., _Mathematical Techniques in Multisensor Data Fusion_. Artech House, 2004
- _Good sections overviewing general strategies and structures for multisensor fusion; presents problems with respect to localizing
multiple targets (read, military applications). Extensively references Kalman filters as industry standard. No explicit walkthrough
of practical Kalman filter application._  

[2] Gomex, Joaquin M., _Kalman Filtering_. Nova Science Publishers Inc. 2011
- _An Ebook in the Olin Library collection.

## Papers

[3] Sorenson, H. W., "Least Squares Estimation: From Gauss to Kalman," _IEEE Spectrum_, 1970, pp. 63-68
- _Provides historical background behind least squares and kalman filters._  

[4] Faragher, R., "Understanding the basis of the Kalman filter via a simple and intuitive derivation"
_IEEE Signal Process. Mag._, 2012, 29, pp. 128-132  
- _Text cited by bzarg.com article [5]._

## Websites  
[5] Ulusoy, Melda. “Understanding Kalman Filters.” MathWorks Video & Webinar Series, www.mathworks.com/videos/series/understanding-kalman-filters.html.  
- _7-part video series about Kalman filters. Approaches them from the perspective of block diagrams and controls, unlike some of the other sources. Discusses Kalman filters from the perspective of state observers/estimators. Uses some terms from Bayesian Inference, and explicitly addresses Kalman filters as stochastic systems.
