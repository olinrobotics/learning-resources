# Blog Post 1: 1D Kalman Filter Implementation
*November 30th, 2018*

In order to solidify the fundamental concepts of Kalman filters before implementing a non-linear filter for full positioning of the Neato, we implemented a 1-dimensional Kalman filter to track the Neato's position in a single dimension. We used this process to help us design our data collection framework and class structure, making the code as modular as possible to ensure that as we created new filters, we did not have to re-write implementation code.
