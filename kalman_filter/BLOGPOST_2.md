# Blog Post 2: Working Implementation
_December 7th, 2018_

This week, all of the components created last week came together and produced a working 1D Kalman Filter, as well as a base for us to continue to build upon. The robot is now able to easily create log files of all useable sensors as csv files, and we have created some test datasets using this functionality. We have also created a parsing and plotting script that, given a csv file, can run a kalman filter on the sensors within and display the results as related to the ground truth logging. This visual has allowed us to verify that our filter works, and we are thus ready to move on to further kalman filters.

# Sensor Logging
- List full sensor logging, format of csv files

# Data Visualization
- Current logging state, raw data example vis
- Visualization of estimates on line break, explain points in data
- visualization of estimates on circle problem, explain points in data, need extended kalman filter

# Further Plans
- Next step: Multi-dimensional Kalman Filters
- How our architecture needs to change to support us
